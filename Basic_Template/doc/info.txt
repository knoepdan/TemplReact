########### Template basis ###########
https://github.com/rokoroku/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate  (main base)
https://hackernoon.com/react-with-typescript-and-webpack-654f93f34db6
https://github.com/saurabhpati/react-ts-webpack-boilerplate

Requirements: 
- Typscript Hot reload
- CSS modules
- Some kind of Linting
- File references (images, etc.)
- Environment variables and configuration
-- can be very basic  (example: also be solved later by a separate config file 
- Build with minification
- No major obstacles for a growing application

wanted extensions (todo): 
- manifest etc. 
- mobile icons


other possible extensions (maybe not for basic template): 
- remove babel as unnecessary dependency (maybe still needed and very low priority)
- tests (jest)
- state management
- extended environment variables (probably not needed)
- uglification (to some degree already achieved, most probably not needed)
- typing for css (existing plugin: "typings-for-css-modules-loader" tried and did not get it running. not really needed anyway )


########### Steps done ###########
1. started with base template: https://github.com/rokoroku/react-mobx-typescript-boilerplate
2. upgraded libraries (with minimal code changes necessary)
3. Simply app and remove references to redux etc.
4. integrate eslint and prettier (prettier was already included but was adapted a bit)
   https://dev.to/robertcoopercode/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project-53jb (tslint is deprecated and replaced by eslint)
   https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/why-and-how-to-use-eslint-in-your-project-742d0bc61ed7 (general)
   https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started
   -> apply Eslint+prettier upon save in VS code: install "ESLint (with 'autoFixOnSave..." + "Prettier - Code formatter" (will create vscode settings file)
5. examples in code: favicon, usage of images including adding Ts support for images in global.d.ts, global css using css modules
6. minifying CSS using "optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin"
8. External config file (including extended info in component)
8. Code splitting for scalibility example (tsconfig modules must be set accordingly)

########### General boilerplate links ###########
good tutorial
https://medium.com/p/6b069881229d/responses/show

probably ok but no css
https://github.com/GrantBartlett/react-typescript-webpack-starter/blob/master/package.json

probably very good (has redux but we can remove that)
https://github.com/rokoroku/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate

old (webpack 2) but maybe has some good ideas
https://scalable-react-ts-boilerplate.herokuapp.com/

replace babel boilerplate with typescript
https://itnext.io/add-typescript-to-react-boilerplate-project-332862b53fed

good but probably not ok
