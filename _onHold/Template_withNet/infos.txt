### Current state 15.8.2020 ### 
- on hole because not crucial at this point (and also no ideal solution found, probably approach that injects webpack js/css references into .cshtml file (like done at DK) is most promising to work with debugging or and productive build)
- it would be nice because: 
-- so configuration could be integrated in index (or initial html page). No additional load would be needed
-- some configuration params could be calculated on the fly (like baseUrl)
-- no cors needed
- but maybe not needed because: 
-- we already have a working external configuration
-- configuration could be integrated into initial page in deployment step if it was really needed
-- params calculated on the fly probably not needed (and if yes, the could be retrieved via api call)
-- cors would a) not be a problem to configure, b) could be simply avoided by deploying the apps together
