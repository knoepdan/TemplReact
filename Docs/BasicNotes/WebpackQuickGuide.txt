############ Webpack ############

## Corner points to get it running: 
1. install webpack
2. create webpack.config.js
3. add "scripts" part in ackage.json  (example: "build": "webpack")
4. -> npm run build


## Other important points: 
- webpack-dev-server (livereload, running in memory, hot module replacement (??))
- loaders: preprocess files (example SASS)
- plugins  (examples: UglifyjsWebpackPlugin (minimize), babel..
- NODE_ENV
