########### Template basis ###########
https://github.com/rokoroku/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate  (main base)
https://hackernoon.com/react-with-typescript-and-webpack-654f93f34db6
https://github.com/saurabhpati/react-ts-webpack-boilerplate

Requirements: 
- Typscript Hot reload
- CSS modules
- Some kind of Linting
- File references (images, etc.)
- Environment variables
-- can be very basic  (example: also be solved later by a separate config file 
- Build with minification
- No major obstacles for a growing application

wanted extensions (todo): 
- minification of css
- example of splitting js (and maybe css) into junks for performance
- manifest etc. 
- mobile icons (https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin)

other possible extensions (maybe not for this template): 
- remove babel as unnecessary dependency (maybe still needed and very low priority)
- tests (jest)
- extended environment variables (probably not needed)
- uglification (to some degree already achieved, most probably not needed)
- typing for css (if possible: https://github.com/Jimdo/typings-for-css-modules-loader)

Possible extensions: 
- remove unnecessary dependencies (@types/history, gh-pages, babel?)
- tests (jest)
- state management
- extended environment variables (probably not needed)
- uglification (to some degree already achieved, most probably not needed)


########### Steps done ###########
1. started with base template: https://github.com/rokoroku/react-mobx-typescript-boilerplate
2. upgraded libraries (with minimal code changes necessary)
3. Simply app and remove references to redux etc.
4. integrate eslint and prettier (prettier was already included but was adapted a bit)
   https://dev.to/robertcoopercode/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project-53jb (tslint is deprecated and replaced by eslint)
   https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/why-and-how-to-use-eslint-in-your-project-742d0bc61ed7 (general)
   https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started
   -> apply Eslint+prettier upon save in VS code: install "ESLint (with 'autoFixOnSave..." + "Prettier - Code formatter" (will create vscode settings file)
5. Setup tests
	- 1. JEST:  npm i jest @types/jest ts-jest --dev  (plus setup test script)
	- 	 -> add jest.config.js
	- 2. Enzyme: npm i enzyme @types/enzyme enzyme-to-json enzyme-adapter-react-16 ---dev
		-> adapt jest.config.js and add src/setupEnzyme.ts
	- 3. Fix typings for enzymeadapter-react-16
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46435558/could-not-find-declaration-file-for-enzyme-adapter-react-16
		(should have typings:  npm install --save @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16 but doesnt seem to work https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/enzyme-adapter-react-16 )
	- 4. make it work with css modules
		npm install -D jest-css-modules
		-> adapt jest.config.js to ignore css module imports
		https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-css-modules
6. State with ReactHooks
	https://github.com/avkonst/hookstate#quick-start
7. examples in code: favicon, usage of images including adding Ts support for images in global.d.ts, global css using css modules



########### General boilerplate links ###########
good tutorial
https://medium.com/p/6b069881229d/responses/show

probably ok but no css
https://github.com/GrantBartlett/react-typescript-webpack-starter/blob/master/package.json

probably very good (has redux but we can remove that)
https://github.com/rokoroku/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate

old (webpack 2) but maybe has some good ideas
https://scalable-react-ts-boilerplate.herokuapp.com/

replace babel boilerplate with typescript
https://itnext.io/add-typescript-to-react-boilerplate-project-332862b53fed

good but probably not ok
